    "### Data Analysis using Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we discussed how to analyze multiple columns using for loops and indexing to filter data and find the required values. We iterated over each row, checked conditions manually, and counted or displayed relevant records.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, pandas provides built-in functions that allow us to perform the same operations with just one line of code using conditions. These functions make data analysis much simpler and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "we will explore how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use conditions in pandas for data filtering.\n",
    "2. Answer key questions using conditions.\n",
    "3. Compare this approach to the previous method of loop-based filtering."
